## Description

Almost everyone uses at least one form of social media. As a result, it's important as a developer to know and understand the technologies that many social platforms use. I've created a social networking API, that allows its' users to add (or remove) friends &#128527;, share thoughts and reactions. The best part is, if anyone overshares or overreacts, as many do on social media, they can delete their thought &#128173; and reaction! To find out how I was able to create this api, please watch my [walkthrough video](https://app.castify.com/view/b1a74d0e-7156-4733-8925-626cf32472ae)!

## Installation

After setting up my repo, the first action item I tackled was creating the file structure. I knew I needed a 'connection file' that created a connection to Mongoose and my 'socialNetworkDB', models, routes and last but not least, a server. Once that was complete, I moved on to installing two npm packages- [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose). To install the packages, I typed the following into the command line:
```
 npm i express --save; npm i mongoose
 ```
